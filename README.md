# Bus Route System Website 🚌
The Bus Route System Website is a frontend web application designed to manage and display bus route information in a structured and user-friendly way. The project includes both public-facing pages and an admin panel UI for route management.
⚠️ **Note:** This repository currently contains **frontend only**. Backend functionality was originally built using **PHP**, but it has been removed because GitHub Pages does not support PHP. Full functionality will be restored in the future by integrating a backend.

## 🚀 Features
### 🌐 Public Pages
- **Home** – Overview of the bus route system
- **About** – Information about the system and its purpose
- **Routes** – Displays available bus routes (UI only)
- **Contact** – Contact form interface (non-functional without backend)

### 🔐 Admin Panel (UI Only)
- Admin login page (frontend design)
- Add new bus routes
- Update existing routes
- Delete routes
> All admin actions are currently **UI-level only** and do not persist data without a backend.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Frontend
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**

### Backend (Removed)
- **PHP** (to be reintegrated in the future)

## 🧠 Project Purpose
This project was created to:
- Practice frontend development and UI structuring
- Design an admin panel workflow
- Understand CRUD-based system design
- Prepare for future full-stack integration

## ⚙️ Current Limitations
- No data persistence
- Admin authentication is UI-only
- Forms do not submit data to a server
- Routes are not stored or fetched dynamically

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integrate backend using **PHP / Node.js**
- Add database support (MySQL / MongoDB)
- Implement real authentication
- Enable full CRUD operations
- Deploy complete version on a backend-supported serve
